# Unity Game! 
## TurtlesGV 
### Purpose
This is my repository for CIS376 - Game Programming with Mr.W. 

This will serve as source control and a place to demo my final project. After a slightly tumultous semester with an unexpected surgery, I finally got to sit down for a long time and play with Unity without having to context switch. I'm elated with what I've gotten done so far and will definitely continue to iterate over this game!  

  So far I've implemented my player who is a red turtle. He has the ability to shoot pizzas. This is done by left-clicking on the screen; The pizza will then be launched from the turtle's shell in the direction of the click. Keys to move the turtle are W/S forward/backward, and A/D for left/right rotation.  
  
  I also have a mutant pig enemy and a mutant rhino enemy that are controlled by AI. They patrol and attack the turtle if he gets too close. Both have rigid bodies and colliders so we can shoot them with pizzas. Any ideas connotative of TMNT are purely coincidental. 
  

### Next Steps  
  I'd like to continue to fine-tune the behavior tree script and have movements better correlated with animations for the prefabs, add hitpoints to the bosses, and destroy the characters once they've been hit enough times.
